A note about getting the Pertelian to work with this project.

First of all, one needs the development files installed on the system.
These can be obtained from 
http://developer.pertelian.com/
A copy of a recent SDK is placed in the "extras" directory.
(Bit unsure about License, I think it is GPL or similar).

You need to install the SDK in order to compile support for the
display into ssfh.

** Linux

The Linux SDK is embedded in the SDK zip file. It uses autoconf, and
is easy to install.

In order to configure, you should set up an udev rule, something like
the example rule in this directory. (pertelian-display.rules)
