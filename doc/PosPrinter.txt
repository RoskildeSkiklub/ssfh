The code included in the system is written for at "POS 104" printer.
I have no idea who the manufactorer is.
It is made in Taiwan. It was sold as a "POS-104". The documentation
refers to it as a PRP-085IIIT. Its probably a cheap knockoff of an
Epson series printer.

It should be pretty standard ESC/POS.

* Linux setup

It is assumed the user has write access to the device the printer is
connected to. This will most often be /dev/usb/lp0. 

The easiest way is probably to have the user be a member of the "lp"
group, which in most Linux distros will have write access to line printers.
