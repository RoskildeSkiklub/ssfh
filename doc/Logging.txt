SnowStuffForHire uses a simple log system, that is mostly useful for
debugging errors and bugs in the system.

You must provide a name of a logfile to the binary, when started.
ssfh will then trunctate this file, and write logging statements to
it. 

Log lines consists of three columns, seperated by " : "

The first column is a timestamp, in ISO8601 (in localtime).

Second column is a level, one of trace, debug, todo, info, warn, error
and fatal.

* trace is used for function entering and exit
* debug is used for debug messages, there are quite a lot
* todo is used for todo messages
* info is information about what goes on in the system in a higher
  level. (Currently very few, too much have become debug, I am afraid).
* warn is warnings about stuff that you might want to look into
* errors is errors that was unexpected, and that the system have some
  trouble handling.
* fatal is for fatal stuff, like out of memory, stuff like that.

The system tries to log information about item ids and contract ids,
as these are vital to postmortem a bug in the field.
